# TMS Planner Visualization Examples

This directory contains example visualizations generated by the TMS Conference Planner. These images demonstrate the different types of calendar views available for various research profiles.

## Available Visualizations

- **Battery Research Calendar** (`battery_calendar.png`): Standard view showing sessions relevant to battery research
- **Battery Research Symposium View** (`battery_calendar_symposium.png`): Symposium-grouped view for battery research
- **Machine Learning Calendar** (`ml_calendar.png`): Standard view showing sessions relevant to machine learning and AI
- **NVIDIA Profile Calendar** (`nvidia_calendar_symposium.png`): Symposium-grouped view for the NVIDIA custom profile

## Visualization Types

The TMS Planner supports two main types of visualizations:

1. **Standard View**: Shows individual sessions organized by day and room, color-coded by research area
2. **Symposium View**: Groups sessions by symposium, providing a higher-level overview of the conference schedule

## Interactive vs. Static Visualizations

The images in this directory are static PNG exports of the interactive HTML visualizations. For the full interactive experience with hover details, filtering options, and more:

1. Generate the HTML visualizations using the commands in the main README
2. Open the HTML files in a web browser
3. Interact with the visualizations to explore your personalized schedule

## Regenerating Visualizations

If you need to regenerate these example images or create new ones:

```bash
# Generate PNG files with the fix_pngs.sh script
cd /path/to/tms-planner
./fix_pngs.sh

# Generate a specific visualization
python3 src/plotly_viz.py --profile battery --min-score 5 --output docs/images/battery_calendar.html --export-png
```

The PNG files will be created alongside the HTML files with the same base name.
